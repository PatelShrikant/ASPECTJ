# AspectJ
Metrics Analysis of OOPs and AOP


AspectJ is an aspect-oriented programming (AOP) extension created at PARC for the Java programming language. It is available in Eclipse Foundation open-source projects, both stand-alone and integrated into Eclipse. AspectJ has become a widely used de facto standard for AOP by emphasizing simplicity and usability for end users. It uses Java-like syntax, and included IDE integrations for displaying crosscutting structure since its initial public release in 2001.



that Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is a paradigm that provides features to overcome the limitations of OOP and patterns. However even with the good results achieved using AOP, it is possible to cause side effects in code. 



This report shows the background information about this area of research and sets the context of the project. It presents the aim, the specific objectives, and provides a description of the methodology selected.




Benefits of AOP

•	Solve the problem of cross cutting procedures: As mentioned in the above section of limitations of oop , we found out that oop does’t have any six special way to solve the problemof crosscutting procedures,so AOP overcome this problem.
•	Modularity: It lets the developer better separate tasks that should not be inextricably tangled such as mathematical operations and exceptional handling.
•	Performance: It improves performance because the operations are more succinct.
•	Development Time and Maintenance Time: It allows programmers to spend less time rewriting the same code .overall AOP enables better encapsulation of distinct procedures and promotes future interoperation hence maintenance is comparatively easy. 
•	Functionality: Using aspects it is possible to add new functionality without modifying the base program.
•	Testing: AOP can be used with software testing .Advices can be bound to method calls to measure invocation counts and execution time.



steps for build and run project 
1. create a package with name "customer".
2. add all this file in the package .
3. add aspectjrt.jar file in your libraries folder 
4. select main project as customer 
5. select newLstTemplate.lst file to confiure with aspectj compiler 
6. run project



this project show the crosscutting concept of aop for better and easy implementation of software.
